[Section 4.5 of that document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8713#section-4.5) requires the Internet Society President to select the Chair of the Nomination Committee (NomCom). 

## Responsibilities
The NomCom Chair is responsible for planning and executing the process for leadership selection as specified in RFC8713. This chair’s primary role is to ensure the effective operation of the NomCom while adhering to the demanding timelines. 

The NomCom chair is responsible for interacting with the various leadership bodies such as the IESG, IAB, IETF Trust etc. to obtain the list of positions to be filled and the job descriptions for those positions. The chair also communicates with these bodies (as well as confirming bodies) to get the liaisons appointed. 

The chair works with the IETF Secretariat to develop a list of qualified volunteers to serve as voting members and is responsible for running a publicly verifiable random selection process (e.g. RFC3797) to select the voting members.

Once the voting members are selected the NomCom chair is expected to initiate the working phase of the NomCom. The initial tasks include choosing voting mechanisms, developing written questionnaires, and calling for nominees. Once the nominations have closed, the chair initiates the gathering of feedback from the community about the nominees and works with the secretariat for arranging and scheduling interviews with the nominees. The chair drives the deliberation process of the NomCom to ensure that the selections are made in a timely manner in accordance to the job descriptions and the community feedback.

After the NomCom completes the selection process for the open positions, the NomCom chair is expected to lead the NomCom to be proactively accountable to the confirming bodies. This entails the initiation of the confirmation process, that includes developing write ups that describes and motivates the NomCom’s selection process to the confirming bodies, in order to assist them in their decision making. 

##Commitment
